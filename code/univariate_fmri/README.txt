Configuration for 1st-level (run timeseries), 2nd-level (within-subject,
fixed effects_, and 3rd-level (group mean, random effects) analyses with
FSL's FEAT pipeline.

1st- and 2nd-level configuration files need to be adjusted for actual data base
directory (search and replace BASEDIR), and subject ID (search and replace
SUBJID). 3rd-level analysis configuration only needs adjustment for BASEDIR.
